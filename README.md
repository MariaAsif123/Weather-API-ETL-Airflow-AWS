# Weather-API-ETL-Airflow-AWS
In this project, I have built and automated an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow on an AWS EC2 instance to extract, transform, and load current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API into an Amazon S3 bucket. The project demonstrates how to set up and configure Apache Airflow from scratch on AWS, create DAGs for scheduling and orchestrating tasks, and utilize Airflow operators like sensors to monitor API availability. Key concepts such as DAG creation, task dependency, and ETL pipeline automation are covered in this hands-on data engineering project.

## Technologies Used
- Apache Airflow
- AWS (EC2 & S3)
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Python
